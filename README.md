# Analysis-and-Visualization-on-Chocolate-Dataset

Chocolate remains a globally cherished confection, with consumption patterns varying widely across different regions. In Canada, for instance, the average annual per capita consumption reaches 6.4 kilograms, equivalent to approximately 160 standard chocolate bars. Preferences for chocolate, however, differ significantly worldwide, influenced by factors such as cocoa content, bean variety, geographic origin, and manufacturing standards. This study aims to rigorously evaluate consumer satisfaction with chocolate bars by examining key variables, including cocoa percentage, cocoa bean type and origin, and the country of manufacture. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing leading global manufacturers, this research seeks to derive actionable insights to inform India's strategic entry into the premium chocolate manufacturing sector. Through detailed data analysis, we construct a framework to guide market positioning and product development in this competitive industry.
